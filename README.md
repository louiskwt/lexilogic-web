# Lexigram - Web App

This is a web grame created for students to learn English vocabulary through mini games.
Currently, it's powered by [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and under active devlopment.

This project also leveraged the following frontend tech:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
